This work is part of the NSF Preventive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention (PIPP) Institute <a href="https://compass-pipp.org/">COMPASS Center</a> where we are developing knowledge-guided generative models  to predict harmful mutations in viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 that have the potential to jump to humans and cause the next pandemic. This institute is led by VT with collaborators from Cornell University, University of Michigan, Wake Forest University, and Meharry Medical College.
